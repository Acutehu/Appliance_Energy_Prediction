# Appliance_Energy_Prediction
This project explores residential appliance energy consumption, considering inherent appliance traits and environmental dynamics in various living spaces. Using a dataset with temperature, humidity, and environmental data for distinct areas, we aim to predict nuanced energy usage patterns for optimized efficiency.
